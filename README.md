## **Overview**
AircraftHealthML is a machine learning project focused on integrated aircraft health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and component interaction analysis. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and multi-source datasets, the project aims to predict failures, analyze cascading faults, and optimize maintenance strategies in aviation systems.

## **Features**
- Anomaly detection for fault identification.
- Predictive maintenance using time-series modeling.
- Component interaction analysis with graph-based methods.
- Integration of multiple datasets for unified diagnostics.
- Comprehensive evaluation and optimization of machine learning models.

## **Datasets**
1. **[NASA ADAPT Dataset](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/adapt-dataset)**: Electrical power system fault scenarios.
2. **[NGAFID Maintenance Logs](https://www.ngafid.org/)**: Annotated time-series data linked to unplanned maintenance events.
3. **[Engine Run-to-Failure Dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/)**: Real-world degradation trajectories for aircraft engines.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM (Anomaly Detection)
  - LSTMs, Bayesian Networks, Gaussian Processes (Predictive Maintenance)
  - Graph Neural Networks (Component Interaction Analysis)
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
  - Data Normalization and Fusion
- **Programming and Tools**:
  - Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

## **Use Cases**
- Early fault detection to prevent critical failures.
- Optimization of maintenance schedules for cost reduction.
- Enhanced safety through anomaly detection in real-time.
